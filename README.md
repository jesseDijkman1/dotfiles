# JesseDijkman1 Dotfile 

Wasn't able to find .bash_profile, .bashrc in root so I made .bash_profile (touch .bash_profile)

> Dotfiles are plain text files that start with a period which makes them hidden for the user.

I was looking for the files ```.bash_profile```, ```.bashrc``` and ```.profile```. I couldn't find them so I made ```.bash_profile``` with the command: ```touch .bash_profile``` in my home directory. 

This ```.bash_profile``` dotfile changes the prompt (PS1 and PS2), adds a few aliases like: 
* ``` ~ ``` is now the command to go to the home directory.
* ``` lsa ``` is now the command to show all files including the hidden ones.
* and more (description is included in the ```.bash_profile``` dotfile)
