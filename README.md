## Dotfile .bash_profile

Wasn't able to find .bash_profile, .bashrc in root so I made .bash_profile (touch .bash_profile)

>Dotfiles are plain text files that start with a period which makes them hidden for the user.

**Install homebrew**

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
**Link:** https://brew.sh/  
run this in your terminal
